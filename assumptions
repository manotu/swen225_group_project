1) Specfications do not state what happens to the physical player token on the board when they lose.
So, we decided when a player loses we put them in a cellar in order to graphically see who has lost.

ï¿¼2) Each individual movement from the player token is prompted by System.in, up to the maximum number of movements
determined by the sum of the dice rolls.

3) At the start of the game, we need a way for players to choose their game characters. 
We assume that players 1, 2, 3, e.t.c. in sequence choose which character to play.

4) Specifications states that squares "(those within rooms) may optionally be treated as a single location".
We are treating squares within rooms as multiple multiple squares, not a single location"

5) Specifications states that the "prototype does not need to honour the fact that rooms are technically not 
divided by grid cells in the original game". We are treating rooms as being divided into grid cells.
